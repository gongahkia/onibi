# KELP 🌿🌊

The *K*ommand line h*elp*er.

Written in Rust, because we love crabs.

Installation handled in Bash, because making *Kelp* felt like bashing my head in.

## Installation and usage

1. Run the following commands in your terminal.

```console
$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gongahkia/Kelp/main/installer.sh
$ chmod +x installer.sh
$ ./installer.sh
```

2. After running the Rust installer, we have to add a line of code to the **bottom** of our `.bashrc` file to indicate the file path. Remember to **source** your `.bashrc` file. (Neovim is used below, but any other code editor can be used).

```console
$ nvim ~/.bashrc
$ source ~/.bashrc
```

*Line to be added:* 

```bash
export PATH=~/.config/Kelp-build:$PATH
```

3. Finally, `cd` back into the directory that we previously ran the `installation.sh` binary in, and remove the installation files.

```console
$ rm -r installer.sh Kelp
```

---

## Uninstalling Kelp

```console
$ cd ~/.config
$ rm -r Kelp-build
```

Additionally, remember to remove the line added to your `.bashrc` file. 

```console
$ nvim ~/.bashrc
-- removes final line from file
```
