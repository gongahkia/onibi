(B) Add hasCompletedOnboarding check in GhosttyMenubarApp.swift applicationDidFinishLaunching to conditionally show OnboardingView on first launch +feature

(B) Guard against negative fontSize values in GhosttyConfigParser.swift parseColor/value parsing with validation +stability
(B) Remove duplicate shell hook installation check — current alreadyInstalled in ShellHookInstaller.swift uses broad string contains match that can false positive on partial matches; use exact marker line match +stability
(B) Add verify step after shell hook install in ShellHookInstaller.swift that cleans up the test log entry it writes +stability
(B) Fix ShellHookInstaller.swift uninstall to preserve existing newlines — current aggressive newline removal can break rc file formatting +stability
(B) Add backup rotation (keep last 3 backups) in ShellHookInstaller.swift instead of single backup that gets overwritten +stability
(B) Add PROMPT_COMMAND collision check in FileWatcher.swift bash hook — check if already set before appending to avoid double-execution +stability
(B) Fix badge count in MenuBarController.swift — add decrementNotificationCount method called on dismiss and wire clearAll to reset to zero +stability
(B) Stop ShimmerEffect repeatForever animation in UIUtilities.swift when the loading state ends — use conditional animation modifier +performance
(B) Make SuccessToast auto-dismiss duration configurable via parameter instead of hardcoded 2s in UIUtilities.swift +refactor
(B) Add SwiftLint configuration file .swiftlint.yml with project-specific rules to make CI lint step pass consistently instead of continue-on-error +infra
(B) Add test target to Package.swift referencing GhosttyMenubarTests directory so tests can run via swift test as well as xcodebuild +infra
(B) Add unit tests for JSONStorageManager — test atomic write, backup recovery, cache flush, concurrent access +infra
(B) Add unit tests for FalsePositiveReducer — test deduplication window, confidence scoring, suppression patterns +infra
(B) Add unit tests for SessionManager — test session creation, activity recording, inactive pruning, cleanup +infra
(B) Add unit tests for GhosttyConfigParser — test key=value parsing, key-value parsing, color parsing, invalid input +infra
(B) Add unit tests for ShellHookInstaller — test install/uninstall for each shell, backup creation, collision detection +infra
(B) Add integration test that exercises full pipeline: write log line → FileWatcher detects → LogBuffer reads → EventDetector matches → notification emitted +infra
(B) Add DMG code signing step to ci.yml release job using Developer ID certificate for Gatekeeper compatibility +infra
(B) Add notarization step to ci.yml release job using xcrun notarytool so users don't get Gatekeeper warnings +infra
(B) Pin macos-latest to macos-14 in ci.yml to prevent CI breakage when GitHub updates runner images +infra
(B) Add Xcode version matrix (15.0, 15.4) to ci.yml build-and-test job for forward compatibility testing +infra
(B) Add GhosttyCliService.isGhosttyInstalled() check that verifies `ghostty` binary exists in PATH and returns version string +feature +integration
